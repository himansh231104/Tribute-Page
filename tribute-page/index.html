      <h3 class="hero__subtitle">A Visionary Leader, Philanthropist, and Industrialist Who Shaped Modern India</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="hero__intro-para">
      <p class="hero__intro"><q class="hero__quote">Ratan Tata, a stalwart of Indian industry, was not just a businessman but a visionary leader. His remarkable journey transformed the Tata Group into a global powerhouse while fostering a spirit of philanthropy and innovation. Known for his humility and integrity, Tata’s influence extends far beyond corporate success, shaping the future of countless lives.</q><br><br>Ratan Tata was born on December 28, 1937, into the prestigious Tata
        family in Mumbai, India. Raised by his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, after his parents separated, Ratan grew
        up in a nurturing environment. He attended Campion School in Mumbai, followed by Cathedral and John Connon
        School, before heading to the U.S. to study architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University. He
        later pursued a management course at Harvard Business School. <br><br>

        Ratan Tata's early experiences shaped his leadership style—one grounded in humility, ethics, and innovation.</p>

      <h2 class="hero__subheading">Leadership at Tata Group</h2>
      <p class="hero-content">Ratan Tata took over as Chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, guiding the Tata Group through a
        transformative era. Under his leadership, the company expanded its global footprint, with key acquisitions like
        Tetley Tea (UK), Corus Steel (UK), and the iconic Jaguar Land Rover (UK). His vision was not only to globalize
        Tata but also to instill a culture of transparency, environmental responsibility, and ethical governance.
        <br><br>

        During his tenure, the Tata Group's revenues grew exponentially, from $5.7 billion in 1992 to nearly $100
        billion when he retired in 2012. He was instrumental in launching path-breaking products like the Tata Nano, the
        world's most affordable car, and Tata Indica, the first indigenously developed car in India.

      <h2 class="hero__subheading">Humanitarian Work and Philanthropy</h2>
      <p class="hero__content">Beyond business, Ratan Tata's legacy is deeply rooted in his philanthropic efforts. A
        major portion of the Tata Group's profits was funneled into charitable trusts focused on education, healthcare,
        and rural development. His contributions toward cancer research, child education, and poverty alleviation are
        noteworthy. <br><br>

        One of Ratan Tata's key initiatives was improving access to healthcare. He played a pivotal role in funding
        advanced medical research, and through the Tata Memorial Hospital, millions of underprivileged patients received
        free treatment. <br><br>

        He also had a deep passion for animal welfare, supporting causes aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating street
        animals. His quiet, understated approach to philanthropy earned him widespread admiration, as he believed in
        creating impact without seeking recognition.</p>

        honorary knighthood from the UK in 2009. <br><br>

      <p class="hero__content">Ratan Tata was known for his simplicity, humility, and strong ethical principles. A man
        of few words, he led by example, embodying the values of integrity and kindness. Despite his tremendous wealth
        and influence, he lived a modest lifestyle, often found driving himself around Mumbai in his own car, without
        the pomp that usually accompanies people of his stature. <br><br>
        
        He was also a deeply private man who never married, though he admitted in an interview that he had come close to
        it a few times.</p>
